//! The command-line surface: every `nebula` subcommand, its arguments, and the
//! help each one prints. `main.rs` owns only the dispatch and the logging.
//!
//! Two rules keep `--help` readable, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **Every doc comment is two paragraphs.** `clap_derive` takes the first
//!   paragraph as `about` and the whole comment as `long_about`, and the root's
//!   command list only ever renders `about` — so paragraph one is a single
//!   sentence under ~60 characters that has to stand alone, and the prose after
//!   the blank line is what `nebula <command> --help` shows.
//! * **Examples are `after_help`**, which `after_long_help` falls back to, so
//!   one string serves both `-h` and `--help`. Clap runs it through the same
//!   wrapper as everything else: keep every line under ~78 characters or the
//!   hand-aligned columns reflow into a mess on a narrow terminal.
//!
//! Wrapping itself comes from clap's `wrap_help` feature (see Cargo.toml).
//! Without it `StyledStr::wrap` compiles to a no-op and no width setting here
//! does anything at all.
